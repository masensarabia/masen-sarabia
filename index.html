            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Originally from Houston, Texas, I moved to Utah with my wife to be closer to family on my dad’s side, who settled here shortly after arriving in the United States from Culiacán, Mexico. We have two young children, Holland and Mackenzie, and are expecting our third child soon. Another reason we relocated to Utah was for its beautiful outdoors, as Houston’s concrete swamp didn't provide many opportunities for exploration. While our kids are still too young to fully enjoy the outdoor activities, we’re excited to introduce them to everything Utah has to offer as they grow older.</p>

            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>I currently work as an Enterprise Technical Success Manager at ObservePoint, where I manage end-to-end client onboarding processes, lead contract negotiations, identify and pursue upsell opportunities, and effectively resolve complex technical issues. My role is centered on helping clients optimize their use of our web auditing tool, ensuring they extract maximum value from their subscription while also discovering additional features that enhance their experience.</p>
            <p>ObservePoint works by visiting thousands of web pages, allowing them to fully load, and then downloading the content as a HAR (HTTP Archive) file. This file captures all data related to the page load, including network requests, file sizes, load times, cookies, and JavaScript activity. The extracted data is then structured into intuitive dashboards, enabling users to monitor site performance, validate analytics implementations, and configure alerts for any identified issues.</p>
            <p>One of the aspects I find most rewarding about my role is the ability to add custom JavaScript to audits. This allows us to perform specific checks that go beyond the platform’s default capabilities. I collaborate with clients to brainstorm solutions, and then we integrate custom scripts into their existing audits. These scripts help automate more of their day-to-day tasks, collect additional data beyond the HAR file, and achieve their business goals.</p>
            <p>I have successfully managed a portfolio of key enterprise clients, including industry leaders like Google, AT&T, General Motors, Salesforce, Epson, PGA Tour, Capital One, and Mary Kay, to name a few. My responsibilities include collaborating with diverse teams such as Digital Analysts, Marketers, and IT experts to automate workflows and ensure the seamless operation of our solutions. Additionally, I have led initiatives to improve privacy compliance validation processes, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of our platform's results.</p>
            <p>I’ve also organized and led customer collaboration calls, bringing together over 20 major clients to share their experiences and best practices around privacy compliance. These calls have been incredibly valuable for our customer base, fostering knowledge-sharing and strengthening client retention.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Recently, AutoZone reached out to see if ObservePoint had any ROI calculators that could demonstrate the value of our tool during an upcoming internal business review with their leadership team. Although we didn't have such a calculator at the time, I took the initiative to create one specifically for them. This project involved developing four different calculators for various use cases in ObservePoint.</p>
            <p>Initially, all four calculators were built using Google Apps Script and deployed in Google Sheets. I have since migrated the most critical calculator to a live site hosted on Vercel, which can be accessed here: <a href="https://observe-point-calculators.vercel.app/">ObservePoint ROI Calculator</a>. The remaining three calculators still reside in Google Sheets but are planned to be moved to the website soon.</p>
            <p>I built this project in my free time because I genuinely enjoyed the challenge. The work was completed entirely on my own without any other team members' involvement. After reviewing the project, our CRO expressed great interest, noting its potential value for both existing customers and prospective clients. We are currently in discussions to transition the project to our engineering and product teams for further development.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I’m passionate about exploring new technologies and often find myself tearing apart broken electronics like TVs just to fix them for fun. My wife and I love playing board games like Catan with friends, and we also enjoy outdoor activities when the opportunity arises. As our kids grow, we’re looking forward to introducing them to more outdoor adventures.</p>

            <h2>Recent Learnings and Projects</h2>
            <p>Recently, I’ve learned how to build and deploy web calculators using Vercel, a platform that simplifies frontend deployment. This project involved integrating new skills like setting up version control with Git branches and managing deployments effectively. By applying these skills, I developed a series of ROI calculators for a customer-facing project at ObservePoint. While I successfully moved the most important calculator to a live environment on Vercel, the other three calculators are still managed in Google Apps Script. This experience has deepened my understanding of web development and deployment, and I’m excited to apply these skills to future projects. The work was done in my free time because I genuinely enjoy solving these kinds of challenges.</p>
