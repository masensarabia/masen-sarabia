            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Originally from Houston, Texas, I moved to Utah with my wife to be closer to family and enjoy the beautiful outdoors. We have two young children, Holland and Mackenzie, and are expecting our third child soon. I love spending time with my family and exploring all that Utah has to offer. In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games with friends and learning new technologies.</p>

            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>I currently work as an Enterprise Technical Success Manager at ObservePoint, where I help customers optimize their use of our web auditing tool. ObservePoint works by visiting web pages and, after the page has fully loaded, downloading it as a HAR (HTTP Archive) file. This HAR file captures all the data related to the page load, including network requests, file sizes, load times, and JavaScript activity. ObservePoint then extracts and organizes this data into user-friendly dashboards within the platform, allowing users to monitor their site’s performance, validate their analytics implementations, and set alerts for any issues detected.</p>
            <p>One of the features I enjoy most about ObservePoint is the ability to add custom JavaScript to audits. This allows us to perform specific checks that go beyond the default capabilities of the platform. I work closely with clients to brainstorm automation ideas, write custom scripts, and deploy them across their websites. This not only enhances the value they get from ObservePoint but also significantly streamlines their workflow.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Recently, AutoZone reached out to see if ObservePoint had any ROI calculators that could demonstrate the value of our tool during an upcoming internal business review with their leadership team. Although we didn't have such a calculator at the time, I took the initiative to create one specifically for them. This project involved developing four different calculators for various use cases in ObservePoint.</p>
            <p>Initially, all four calculators were built using Google Apps Script and deployed in Google Sheets. I have since migrated the most critical calculator to a live site hosted on Vercel, which can be accessed here: <a href="https://observe-point-calculators.vercel.app/">ObservePoint ROI Calculator</a>. The remaining three calculators still reside in Google Sheets but are planned to be moved to the website soon.</p>
            <p>I built this project in my free time because I genuinely enjoyed the challenge. The work was completed entirely on my own without any other team members' involvement. After reviewing the project, our CRO expressed great interest, noting its potential value for both existing customers and prospective clients. We are currently in discussions to transition the project to our engineering and product teams for further development.</p>
