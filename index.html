            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Originally from Houston, Texas, I moved to Utah with my wife to be closer to family and enjoy the beautiful outdoors. We have two young children, Holland and Mackenzie, and are expecting our third child soon. I love spending time with my family and exploring all that Utah has to offer. In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games with friends and learning new technologies.</p>

            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>I currently work as an Enterprise Technical Success Manager at ObservePoint, where I help customers optimize their use of our web auditing tool. ObservePoint works by visiting web pages and, after the page has fully loaded, downloading it as a HAR (HTTP Archive) file. This HAR file captures all the data related to the page load, including network requests, file sizes, load times, and JavaScript activity. ObservePoint then extracts and organizes this data into user-friendly dashboards within the platform, allowing users to monitor their site’s performance, validate their analytics implementations, and set alerts for any issues detected.</p>
            <p>One of the features I enjoy most about ObservePoint is the ability to add custom JavaScript to audits. This allows us to perform specific checks that go beyond the default capabilities of the platform. I work closely with clients to brainstorm automation ideas, write custom scripts, and deploy them across their websites. This not only enhances the value they get from ObservePoint but also significantly streamlines their workflow.</p>
